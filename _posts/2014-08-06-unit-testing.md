##Unit Testing and Dependency Injection Techniques

Weâ€™ll use Asp.Net to make it more real Also:

- StructureMap for IoC/DI.
- NSubstitute for faking dependencies.
- NLog as a 3rd party dependency example.

Render a page / partial / widget:

- Downloads latest currency rate from web service.
- Serves a cached data before it expires.
- If a web service call fails, log an error (possibly by email)
- Should return null model if unable to get result.
(view will render N/A state)

We will refactor our code to make it testable.
