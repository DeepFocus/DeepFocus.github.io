EPiServer is a robust Content Management System for ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC websites. It was built for editors and developers alike. Editors have the option of editing their content inline so they can see exactly what their edited pages look like as they edit them. Developers can create strongly-typed page and block types that define the structure of their pages. Overall it is a very powerful CMS that can handle very complex development challenges. Unlike CMSes like Umbraco it requires a license to use but it may well be worth the cost when considering the features it provides.
